Devtank HILTOP Production Tester Buildroot Example
--------------------------------------------------

This is an example production tester.

It of course has nothing to acturally test, so it's just the example mock up hardware tested. Each production tester uses the same framework, but has it's own "binding" required to test what ever it is that is being production tested. More can be found out in the "docs" folder of "devtank-dtlib".
